# K1-OCR-Trust-Automation

A Python tool with a GUI allowing the user to select a K-1 as well as an Excel Workbook, the financial data is then scraped from the K-1 and displayed on the user interface. The user can then make any corrections to misreadings, decide which sheet it wants the data imported into as well as cell selection. The user can then save this as a .JSON mapping for future use. The Excel file can then be imported into the tax software, completely eliminating the need for manual data entry, saving hours of time.
